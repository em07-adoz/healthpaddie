    "bot": "Health education is a social science that helps people learn about health and wellness. It uses information from different areas like biology, environment, psychology, and medicine to teach people how to stay healthy and prevent diseases.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), health education aims to improve health literacy by teaching people new knowledge, skills, and behaviors. This can include teaching people how to make healthy choices, manage risks, and use healthcare services effectively.\n\nThe main goal of health education is to encourage people to take action and make positive changes in their lives to improve their health. It's not just about sharing information, but also about empowering people to make informed decisions and take control of their health.\n\nIf you have any specific questions or concerns about health education, I'd be happy to help. However, for personalized advice or a diagnosis, please consult a healthcare professional."
