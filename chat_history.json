    "bot": "Hello, I'm HealthPaddie. I'm here to help you with your questions about health.\n\nYou asked: what is tuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis, or TB, is a disease caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. It usually affects the lungs, but it can also affect other parts of the body.\n\nTB can exist in two forms: latent TB infection and active TB disease. Latent TB means you have TB germs in your body, but you're not sick and can't spread the germs to others. Active TB disease is when the germs are active and you're sick, which can be fatal if not treated properly.\n\nIf you have symptoms of active TB disease, such as a long-lasting cough, coughing up blood or sputum, weakness, chest pain, fever, or chills, you should see a doctor right away. They can do tests to determine if you have active TB disease and help you get the right treatment.\n\nRemember, if you're concerned about TB or have symptoms that worry you, it's always best to consult a doctor for proper diagnosis and treatment."
